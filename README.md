# florida-county-covid-data
Daily Snapshots of Florida per County Covid-19 Data designed to allow for looking at historical trends along with utilities to download the data and to plot it.

You can see a description of the data set here:

I should have started this earlier, but it took a while to find the underlying data.  Hopefully over time this proves useful.

No credit required in using it, but feel free to drop me a line at covid @ mcguinness.us to let me know if you found it valuable!

The script Florida.py is used to download and process the data, and is run on a daily basis to create the snapshots.

The script county-chart.py is used to produce the graph showing the positive test rates and death rates in the counties.

I know, I'm bad at file naming consistency.
