# florida-county-covid-data
Daily Snapshots of Florida per County Covid-19 Data designed to allow for looking at historical trends.

I should have started this earlier, but it took a while to find the underlying data.  Hopefully over time this proves useful.

No credit required in using it, but feel free to drop me a line at covid @ mcguinness.us to let me know if you found it valuable!
